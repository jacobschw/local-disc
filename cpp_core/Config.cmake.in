# Provide a hint for the library location
# This helps find_package locate the actual library files.
# The include(LocalDiscNameTargets) will be generated by the install(EXPORT ...) command.
include(CMakeFindDependencyMacro)

# Example: If your library depends on Thread, you might do:
# find_dependency(Threads REQUIRED)

# This line will include the LocalDiscNameTargets.cmake file that
# defines the imported target LocalDiscName::your_core_lib
include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/LocalDiscNameTargets.cmake")

# Check that the imported target exists
